                  We want to make the access to classes easy, affordable and fun. No more carrying around DVD/CD cases, create classes your way, share and discover — and no more managing thousands of CD'S or MP3's you stopped using years ago. Instead we're putting together the best ways to discover, collect, share and access classes in one, great product that's available on your computer and on your mobile.

                  <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>

                  <p>
                    Simplecue was founded in 2011 by Stuart Guest-Smith and Suren Reddy, with Aidan Green and Dallas Clark.  We're based in Brisbane, Australia and California. We're funded by Sunship Ventures, as well as a range of private angel investors.
                  </p>

                  <h2>WHAT IT'S LIKE HERE</h2>

                  <p>
                    <b>We're lean and mean.</b> Fewer than 10 people create and maintain Simplecue on the web and iPhone and Android  (and even more platforms are coming). That means you'll spend your time on apps and features that are carefully designed to create great experiences for our customers, and not in endless meetings.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>We're fun and friendly.</b> We like to avoid crazy code-writing and design sprints by planning better and more carefully choosing what to work on. While we have endured the rare all-nighter, they're thankfully the exception.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <b>We're multi-lingual.</b> Ruby, Java, Objective-C, and JavaScript are some of the dialects spoken, but we really want to use whatever suits the job, not make the job suit the language.
                  </p>


                  <h2>WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR</h2>

                    <p>
                      We're looking for someone who is passionate and willing to reshape an industry, take risks and do great work, and equally important: enjoy coming in to the office every morning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Whether your degree (if you have one) is from a top school, and whether it's an Arts Major matters less. We don't hire people by the thousands, and we don't take a simplistic approach to sorting candidates. Instead, we look for people who have been successful in their previous jobs by applying their skills, intellect and opinions to get the job done. If you're a recent graduate, that's fine too. Doubtless you will have many ways of demonstrating to us that you're the right person for the job.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We're only looking for people currently eligible to work in the United States. We're also not big fans of permanently-remote colleagues, so we need you to be able to relocate to the Bay Area — we can be creative with relocation assistance.
                    </p>

                    <h2>BENEFITS</h2>

                    <p>
                      We're a startup, so there are lots of options! We offer great compensation and excellent benefits.
                      They range from tech gadget allowance to potential share options.
